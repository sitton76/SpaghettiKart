# Modding
Modding are really early stages so a lot of features are not implemented yet. We don't use Retro and we want to make it as simple as possible to mod the game (so no weird format or obscure tools).

* Textures Pack
    * Some texture might not be possible to change yet, but most of them can be changed.
    * [link](textures-pack.md)
* Custom Tracks (CT)
    * Custom tracks are reserved for advanced users. We plan to simply the process in the future.
    * [link](custom-track.md)
* Custom Characters
    * Custom characters can only replace existing characters for now. We plan to allow to add new characters in the future.
    * [link](custom-characters.md)
* Custom Music
    * Custom music are not supported yet. We plan to add support for custom music in the future.
* Scripting
    * Add logic to the game are not possible yet but we plan to add support for scripting in the future. We will use [WebAssembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebAssembly) with [component model](https://component-model.bytecodealliance.org/) this will allow you to choose your language (Rust, C, C++, Python, JS, etc.) and compile it to WebAssembly.
* 3D Models For Characters
    * Custom 3D models for characters are not supported yet. Put high quality character can be really close of 3d model but easily add a lot of size to the mod. We plan to add support for custom 3D models in the future.
* Custom Sounds
    * Custom sounds are not supported yet. We plan to add support for custom sounds in the future.
* Custom Menus
    * Custom menus are not supported yet. We plan to add support for custom menus in the future.
